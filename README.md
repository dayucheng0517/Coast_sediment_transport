## Sand
- sources
- sinks
- transport
- storage of sand

## Beach compartments or littoral cells
- sources of beach sand (rivers, streams and some bluff erosion along the coast)
- littoral drift or longshore transport, driven by waves typically coming from the northeast, which move sand southward along most of the Taoyuan coastline
- sinks, or places where sand leaves the shoreline {sand dunes (wind transports the sand inland off the beach) or deep submarine canyons (sand flows offshore and down slope to the deep sea floor)}

## The amount of sand available to beaches = the amount of sand flowing into the littoral cell - the amount flowing out

## The factor of source cutdown
- Man-made structures (dams, jetties and breakwaters)
- Urbanization of watersheds traps sediment under hardened surfaces
